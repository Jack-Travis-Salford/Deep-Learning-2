This assignment was written in Python, utilizing Tensorflow, and consisted of 2 parts:

---1---

The reinforcement learning algoritm, Deep Q-Learning, was researched, detailing what it is and the underlying issues that this method has and how Double Deep Q-Learning circumvents said problems.

An empirical study was then conducted, using the Taxi game available on Gym (https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/toy_text/taxi/#taxi). A Deep Q-learning network was created, with changes made to improve its performance. The same was done with a Double Deep Q-learning network, and the results of the 2 were compared.

---2---

The sequence learning algoritms, RNN and LSTM, were researched and compared before conducting an Empirical study to show the findings of the research in a practical manner. This was done by using the by creating 2 models, one for each algorithm, and using the provided data file, Trip Advisor reviews, to train, test and validate the models ability to calculate the review score, based off the review.

A comment on the likely cause for the relatively low accuracy of both models was also made.
